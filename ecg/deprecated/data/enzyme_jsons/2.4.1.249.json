    "comment": "Ternatins are a group of polyacetylated delphinidin glucosides that confer blue color to the petals of Clitoria ternatea (butterfly pea). This enzyme catalyses two reactions in the biosynthesis of ternatin C5: the conversion of delphinidin 3-O-(6''-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside to delphinidin 3-O-(6''-O-malonyl)-beta-D-glucoside-3'-O-beta-D-glucoside, followed by the conversion of the later to ternatin C5, by transferring two glucosyl groups in a stepwise manner [1].",
