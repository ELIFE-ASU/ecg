    "comment": "This enzyme catalyses two of the steps in the anhydrofructose pathway, which leads to the degradation of glycogen and starch via 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose [1,2]. Aldose-2-uloses such as 2-dehydroglucose can also act as substrates, but more slowly [1,2,4]. This is a bifunctional enzyme that acts as both a lyase and as an isomerase [2]. Differs from EC 4.2.1.111, which can carry out only reaction (1a), is inhibited by its product and requires metal ions for activity [1].",
