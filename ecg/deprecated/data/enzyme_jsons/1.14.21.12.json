Forms the methylenedioxy bridge of the protoberberine alkaloid (S)-nandinine by the oxidative ring closure of adjacent phenolic and methoxy groups of (S)-scoulerine. cf. EC 1.14.21.2, (S)-cheilanthifoline synthase, which catalyses a similar reaction at the other side of the (S)-scoulerine molecule, forming (S)-cheilanthifoline.",
