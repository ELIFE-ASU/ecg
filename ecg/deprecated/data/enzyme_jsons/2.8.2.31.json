    "comment": "The enzyme from the lamprey Petromyzon marinus can also use the corresponding 3-ketone as a substrate. It is stereoselective (5alpha-cholane) and regioselective, exhibiting a preference for an hydroxy group at C-24. The enzyme is inactive when allocholic acid, which has a carboxy group at C-24, is used as a substrate.",
