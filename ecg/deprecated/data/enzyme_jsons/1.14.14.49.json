    "comment": "A cytochrome P450 (heme thiolate) enzyme found in plants. The enzyme acts on jasmonoyl-L-amino acid conjugates that have been hydroxylated at the C-12 position of jasmonic acid by EC 1.14.14.48, jasmonoyl-L-amino acid 12-hydroxylase, further oxidizing that position to a carboxylate via an aldehyde intermediate. While the best studied substrate is (+)-7-epi-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, the enzyme was shown to be active with jasmonoyl-L-phenylalanine, and is likely to be active with other jasmonoyl-amino acid conjugates.",
