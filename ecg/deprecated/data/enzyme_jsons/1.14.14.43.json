    "comment": "This cytochrome P-450 (heme thiolate) enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates in plants. The enzyme catalyses an N-hydroxylation of the E isomer of n-(methylsulfanyl)alkanal oximes, forming an aci-nitro intermediate that reacts non-enzymically with glutathione to produce an N-alkyl-thiohydroximate adduct, the committed precursor of glucosinolates. In the absence of a thiol compound, the enzyme is suicidal, probably due to interaction of the reactive aci-nitro intermediate with active site residues.",
