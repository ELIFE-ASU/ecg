    "comment": "The aurachin C monooxygenase from the bacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca accepts both NADH and NADPH as cofactor, but has a preference for NADH. It catalyses the initial steps in the conversion of aurachin C to aurachin B. The FAD-dependent monooxygenase catalyses the epoxidation of the C2-C3 double bond of aurachin C, which is followed by a semipinacol rearrangement, causing migration of the farnesyl group from C3 to C4.",
