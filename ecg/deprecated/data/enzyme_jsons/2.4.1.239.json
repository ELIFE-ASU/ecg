    "comment": "One of three specific glucosyltransferases in pea (Pisum sativum) that successively add a beta-D-glucosyl group first to O-3 of kaempferol, and then to O-2 of the previously added glucosyl group giving the 3-O-sophoroside and then the 3-O-sophorotrioside (see also EC 2.4.1.91, flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase and EC 2.4.1.240, flavonol-3-O-glycoside glucosyltransferase). TDP-glucose can replace UDP-glucose as the glucose donor but the reaction proceeds more slowly.",
