    "comment": "The reaction makes a six-membered ring by forming a bond between C-6 of the 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl group of the dopamine and C-1 of the aldehyde in the imine formed between the substrates. The product is the precursor of the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids in plants. The enzyme, formerly known as (S)-norlaudanosoline synthase, will also catalyse the reaction of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol + (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde to form (S)-norlaudanosoline, but this alkaloid has not been found to occur in plants.",
