    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Streptomyces rimosus, is bifunctional, catalysing two successive monooxygenation reactions. It starts by catalysing the stereospecific hydroxylation of anhydrotetracycline at C-6 (EC 1.14.13.38). If the released product is captured by EC 1.3.98.4, 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline dehydrogenase (OxyR), it is reduced to tetracycline. However, if the released product is recaptured by OxyS, it performs an additional hydroxylation at C-5, producing 5a,11a-dehydrooxytetracycline, which, following the action of OxyR, becomes oxytetracycline.",
