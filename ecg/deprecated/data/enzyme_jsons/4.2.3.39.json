    "comment": "The enzyme is activated by Mg2+ [2]. Similar to many other plant terpenoid synthases, this enzyme produces many products from a single substrate. The predominant product is the cyclic sesquiterpenoid alcohol, 8-epi-cedrol, with minor products including cedrol and the olefins alpha-cedrene, beta-cedrene, (E)-beta-farnesene and (E)-alpha-bisabolene [1].",
