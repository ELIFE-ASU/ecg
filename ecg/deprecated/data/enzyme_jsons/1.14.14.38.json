    "comment": "A cytochrome P-450 (heme-thiolate) protein. This enzyme catalyses two successive N-hydroxylations of L-valine, the committed step in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside linamarin in Manihot esculenta (cassava). The product of the two hydroxylations, N,N-dihydroxy-L-valine, is labile and undergoes dehydration and decarboxylation that produce the (E) isomer of the oxime. It is still not known whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalysed by the enzyme. The enzyme can also accept L-isoleucine as substrate, with a lower activity. It is different from EC 1.14.14.39, isoleucine N-monooxygenase, which prefers L-isoleucine.",
