    "comment": "The enzyme from the archaeon Picrophilus torridus is involved in D-glucose and D-galactose catabolism via the nonphosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In the direction of aldol synthesis the enzyme catalyses the formation of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-galactonate at a similar ratio. It shows no activity with 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-phosphate. cf. EC 4.1.2.14, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase.",
