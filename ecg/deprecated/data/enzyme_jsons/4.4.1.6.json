    "comment": "A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The enzyme cleaves a carbon-sulfur bond, releasing an alkyl thiol and an unstable enamine product that tautomerizes to an imine form, which undergoes a hydrolytic deamination to form pyruvate and ammonia. The latter reaction, which can occur spontaneously, can also be catalysed by EC 3.5.99.10, 2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate deaminase. Possibly identical, in yeast, with EC 4.4.1.8 cystathionine beta-lyase.",
