    "comment": "The enzyme, isolated from the bacterium Peptoclostridium difficile, is involved in the reductive branch of L-leucine fermentation. It catalyses an alpha/beta-dehydration, which depends on the reductive formation of ketyl radicals on the substrate generated by injection of a single electron from the ATP-dependent activator protein HadI.",
