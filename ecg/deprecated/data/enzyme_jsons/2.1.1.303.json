    "comment": "The enzyme from the bacterium Streptomyces carzinostaticus is involved in the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoate. This compound is part of the enediyne chromophore of the antitumor antibiotic neocarzinostatin. In vivo the enzyme catalyses the regiospecific methylation at the 7-hydroxy group of its native substrate 2,7-dihydroxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoate. In vitro it also recognizes other dihydroxynaphthoic acids and catalyses their regiospecific O-methylation.",
