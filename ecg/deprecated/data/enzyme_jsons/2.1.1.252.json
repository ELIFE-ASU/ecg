    "comment": "The enzyme, which catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from tetramethylammonium to a tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein (MtqC), is involved in methanogenesis from tetramethylammonium. Methylation of the corrinoid protein requires the central cobalt to be in the Co(I) state. During methylation the cobalt is oxidized to the Co(III) state. The methylated corrinoid protein is substrate for EC 2.1.1.253, methylated tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein:coenzyme M methyltransferase.",
