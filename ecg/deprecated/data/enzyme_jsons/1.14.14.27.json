    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005, uses FADH2 as a substrate rather than a cofactor. FADH2 is provided by a dedicated EC 1.5.1.36, flavin reductase (NADH). The enzyme participates in the degradation of gamma-resorcylate and resorcinol. cf. EC 1.14.13.220, resorcinol 4-hydroxylase (NADH), and EC 1.14.13.219, resorcinol 4-hydroxylase (NADPH).",
