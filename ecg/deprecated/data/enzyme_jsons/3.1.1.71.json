    "comment": "Hydrolysis of the acetyl group from the 1-alkyl-2-acetyl and 1-alkyl-3-acetyl substrates occurs at apparently identical rates. The enzyme from Erlich ascites cells is membrane-bound. It differs from lipoprotein lipase (EC 3.1.1.34) since 1,2-diacetyl-sn-glycerols are not substrates. It also differs from EC 3.1.1.47, 1-acetyl-2-alkyl-glycerophosphocholine esterase.",
