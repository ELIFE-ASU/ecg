    "comment": "Together with a hydrolase component (EC 3.1.2.2 and EC 3.1.2.14) and a synthetase component (EC 6.2.1.19), this enzyme forms a multienzyme fatty acid reductase complex that produces the long-chain aldehyde substrate of the bacterial luciferase enzyme (EC 1.14.14.3). The enzyme is acylated by receiving an acyl group from EC 6.2.1.19, and catalyses the reduction of the acyl group, releasing the aldehyde product. The enzyme is also able to accept the acyl group from a long-chain acyl-CoA.",
