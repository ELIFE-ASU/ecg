    "comment": "This cytochrome P-450 (heme thiolate) enzyme acts on 16-methoxytabersonine, leading to biosynthesis of vindoline in the plant Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle). It can also act on tabersonine, resulting in the production of small amounts of vindorosine. The products are unstable and, in the absence of EC 1.1.99.41, 3-hydroxy-1,2-didehydro-2,3-dihydrotabersonine reductase, will convert into 3-epoxylated compounds.",
