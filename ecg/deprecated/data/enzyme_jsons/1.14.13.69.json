    "comment": "This bacterial binuclear non-heme iron enzyme is a multicomponent enzyme complex comprising an oxygenase, a reductase, and a Rieske-type ferredoxin. The enzyme from the bacterium Xanthobacter sp. strain Py2 contains an additional small protein of unknown function that is essential for activity. In general, the enzyme oxygenates C2 to C6 aliphatic alkenes, although enzymes from different organisms show different substrate range. With propene as substrate, the stereospecificity of the epoxypropane formed is 95% (R) and 5% (S).",
