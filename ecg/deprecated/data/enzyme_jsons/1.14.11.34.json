    "comment": "This is one of two simultaneous reactions catalysed by the enzyme, which is responsible for ethylene production in bacteria of the Pseudomonas syringae group. In the other reaction [EC 1.13.12.19, 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (ethylene-forming)] the enzyme catalyses the dioxygenation of 2-oxoglutarate forming ethylene and three molecules of carbon dioxide. The enzyme catalyses two cycles of the ethylene-forming reaction for each cycle of the succinate-forming reaction, so that the stoichiometry of the products ethylene and succinate is 2:1.",
