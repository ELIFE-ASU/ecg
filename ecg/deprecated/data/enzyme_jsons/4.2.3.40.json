    "comment": "This sesquiterpenoid enzyme is constitutively expressed in the root, hydathodes and stigma of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. If the leaves of the plant are wounded, e.g. by cutting, the enzyme is also induced close to the wound site. The sesquiterpenoids (E)-nerolidol and alpha-bisabolol are also produced by this enzyme as minor products.",
