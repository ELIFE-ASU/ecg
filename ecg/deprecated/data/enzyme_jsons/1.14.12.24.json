    "comment": "This enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Burkholderia sp. strain DNT, is a member of the naphthalene family of bacterial Rieske non-heme iron dioxygenases. It comprises a multicomponent system, containing a Rieske [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, an NADH-dependent flavoprotein reductase (EC 1.18.1.3, ferredoxin---NAD+ reductase), and an alpha3beta3 oxygenase. The enzyme forms a cis-dihydroxylated product that spontaneously rearranges to form a catechol with accompanying release of nitrite. It does not act on nitrobenzene. cf. EC 1.14.12.23, nitroarene dioxygenase.",
