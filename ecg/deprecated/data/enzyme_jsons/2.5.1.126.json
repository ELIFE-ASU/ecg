    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, can also synthesize norspermidine from propane-1,3-diamine and thermospermine from spermidine (with lower activity). The long-chain polyamines stabilize double-stranded DNA at high temperatures. In contrast to EC 2.5.1.127, caldopentamine synthase, this enzyme does not accept norspermine as a substrate.",
