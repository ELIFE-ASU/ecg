    "comment": "This cytochrome P-450 (heme-thiolate) enzyme, found in plants, catalyses two successive N-hydroxylations of L-isoleucine, the committed step in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside lotaustralin. The product of the two hydroxylations, N,N-dihydroxy-L-isoleucine, is labile and undergoes dehydration followed by decarboxylation, producing the oxime. It is still not known whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalysed by the enzyme. The enzyme can also accept L-valine, but with a lower activity. cf. EC 1.14.14.38, valine N-monooxygenase.",
