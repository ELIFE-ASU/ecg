    "comment": "The enzyme is part of a two component system that also includes EC 1.5.1.42, FMN reductase (NADH), which provides reduced flavin mononucleotide for this enzyme. It acts on EDTA only when it is complexed with divalent cations such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Co2+, or Cu2+. While the enzyme has a substrate overlap with EC 1.14.14.10, nitrilotriacetate monooxygenase, it has a much wider substrate range, which includes nitrilotriacetate (NTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) in addition to EDTA.",
