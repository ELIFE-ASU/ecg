    "comment": "Simultaneously dephosphorylates and activates EC 6.4.1.2 acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Acts similarly on EC 1.1.1.88 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase), EC 2.4.1.1 (phosphorylase), EC 2.4.1.11 [glycogen(starch) synthase], and dephosphorylates phosphoprotamine and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Not identical to EC 3.1.3.17 ([phosphorylase] phosphatase ) or EC 3.1.3.43 {[pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)]-phosphatase}.",
