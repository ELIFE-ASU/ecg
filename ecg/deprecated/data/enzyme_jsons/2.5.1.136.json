    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from hop (Humulus lupulus), acts on phlorisovalerophenone, phlormethylbutanophenone, and phlorisobutanophenone during the synthesis of bitter acids. It also acts with much lower activity on naringenin chalcone. Forms a complex with EC 2.5.1.137, 2-acyl-4-prenylphloroglucinol 6-prenyltransferase, which catalyses additional prenylation reactions. Requires Mg2+.",
