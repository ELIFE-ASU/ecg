    "comment": "Catalyses the transfer of fatty acids from intact choline- or ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids to the sn-2 position of a lyso-glycerophospholipid. The organyl group on sn-1 of the donor or acceptor molecule can be alkyl, acyl or alk-1-enyl. The term 'radyl' has sometimes been used to refer to such substituting groups. Differs from EC 2.3.1.147 glycerophospholipid arachidonoyl-transferase (CoA-independent) in requiring CoA and not favouring the transfer of polyunsaturated acyl groups.",
