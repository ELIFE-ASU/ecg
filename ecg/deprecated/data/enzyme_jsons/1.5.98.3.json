    "comment": "The enzyme, found in some methanogenic archaea, is responsible for the reoxidation of coenzyme F420, which is reduced during methanogenesis, and for the reduction of methanophenazine to dihydromethanophenazine, which is required by EC 1.8.98.1, dihydromethanophenazine:CoB-CoM heterodisulfide reductase. The enzyme is membrane-bound, and is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force that is used for ATP generation.",
