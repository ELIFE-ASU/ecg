    "comment": "The enzyme, found in bacteria and fungi, can also accept a number of substituted mandelate derivatives, such as 3-hydroxymandelate, 4-hydroxymandelate, 2-methoxymandelate, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelate and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxymandelate. The enzyme has no activity with (S)-mandelate (cf. EC 1.1.99.31, (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase) [1,2]. The enzyme transfers the pro-R-hydrogen from NADH [2].",
