    "comment": "This cytochrome P-450 (heme thiolate) enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates in plants. The enzyme catalyses the N-hydroxylation of aromatic aldoximes derived from L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine, forming an aci-nitro intermediate that reacts non-enzymically with glutathione to produce an N-alkyl-thiohydroximate adduct, the committed precursor of glucosinolates. In the absence of glutathione, the enzyme is suicidal, probably due to interaction of the reactive aci-nitro compound with catalytic residues in the active site.",
