The enzyme from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida shares an NAD(P)H-FMN reductase subunit with EC 1.14.13.178, methylxanthine N1-demethylase, and has higher activity with NADH than with NADPH [1]. Also demethylates caffeine and theophylline with lower efficiency. Forms part of the degradation pathway of methylxanthines.",
