    "comment": "The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate via the two-step pathway in which EC 2.4.1.266 (glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase) catalyses the conversion of GDP-glucose and 3-phospho-D-glycerate into 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate, which is then converted to 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate by glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase. In vivo the enzyme catalyses the dephosphorylation of 2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate with lower efficiency [1,2]. Divalent metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+) stimulate activity [1,2].",
