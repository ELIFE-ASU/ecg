    "comment": "Even though oxygen is consumed, molecular oxygen is not incorporated into the product. Catalysis starts by incorporation of an oxygen atom from a water molecule into the substrate. The naphthalene-1,2,4,8-tetrol intermediate is then oxidized by molecular oxygen, which is reduced to water. Also acts on 1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin and 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone.",
