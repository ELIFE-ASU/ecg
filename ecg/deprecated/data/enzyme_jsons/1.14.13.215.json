    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Streptomyces nodosus subsp. asukaensis, is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic asukamycin. Requires a flavin cofactor, with no preference among FMN, FAD or riboflavin. When flavin concentration is low, activity is enhanced by the presence of the NADH-dependent flavin-reductase AsuE2.",
