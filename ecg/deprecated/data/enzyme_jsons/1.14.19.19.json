    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, produces an all-trans product. Similar triunsaturated sphingoid bases are found in some marine invertebrates. The enzyme determines the position of the double bond by its distance from the alcohol end of the sphingoid base, and contains a cytochrome b5 domain that acts as the direct electron donor to the active site of the desaturase.",
