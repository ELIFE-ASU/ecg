    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enhances the activity of EC 2.4.1.15, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, resulting in elevating the levels of trehalose in the cell and contributing to stationary phase survival. In vitro the enzyme performs S-methylation of L-cysteine residues of various protein substrates.",
