    "comment": "The 20-O-multi-glycoside ginsenosidase catalyses the hydrolysis of the 20-O-alpha-(1->6)-glycosidic bond and the 20-O-beta-(1->6)-glycosidic bond of protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides. The enzyme usually leaves a single glucosyl residue attached at position 20, although it can cleave the remaining glucosyl residue with a lower efficiency. Starting with a ginsenoside that is glycosylated at positions 3 and 20, such as ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3 and Rc, the most common product is ginsenoside Rd, with a low amount of ginsenoside Rg3 also formed.",
