Forms the methylenedioxy bridge of the protoberberine alkaloid cheilanthifoline by the oxidative ring closure of adjacent phenolic and methoxy groups of scoulerine. cf. EC 1.14.21.12, (S)-nandinine synthase, which catalyses a similar reaction at the other side of the (S)-scoulerine molecule, forming (S)-nandinine.",
