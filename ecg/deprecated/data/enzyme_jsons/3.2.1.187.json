    "comment": "The enzyme, which was identified in the bacterium Bifidobacterium longum JCM1217, is specific for (Ara-f)3-Hyp, a sugar chain found in hydroxyproline-rich glyoproteins such as extensin and lectin. The enzyme was not able to accept (Ara-f)2-Hyp or (Ara-f)4-Hyp as substrates. In the presence of 1-alkanols, the enzyme demonstrates transglycosylation activity, retaining the anomeric configuration of the arabinofuranose residue.",
