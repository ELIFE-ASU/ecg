The ubiquitinylation process is now known to be performed by several enzymes in sequence, starting with EC 6.2.1.45 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1) and followed by several transfer reactions, including those of EC 2.3.2.23 (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and EC 2.3.2.27 (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase)",
