The enzyme, which is involved in methanogenesis from mono-, di-, and trimethylamine, catalyses the transfer of a methyl group bound to the cobalt cofactor of several corrinoid proteins (mono-, di-, and trimethylamine-specific corrinoid proteins, cf. EC 2.1.1.248, methylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.249, dimethylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase, and EC 2.1.1.250, trimethylamine---corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase) to CoM, forming the substrate for EC 2.8.4.1, coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase, the enzyme that catalyses the final step in methanogenesis.",
