    "comment": "This enzyme, from the soil proteobacterium and plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58, requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ for activity. GDP-mannose can be replaced by ADP-mannose but with a concomitant decrease in activity. The product of this reaction is dephosphorylated by EC 3.1.3.79 (mannosylfructose-phosphate phosphatase) to form the non-reducing disaccharide mannosylfructose, which is the major endogenous osmolyte produced by several alpha-proteobacteria in response to osmotic stress. The F in the product name is used to indicate that the fructose residue of sucrose carries the substituent.",
