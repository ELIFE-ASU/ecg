    "comment": "Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) from Methanosarcina thermophila is a multifunctional enzyme, part of a five-subunit complex. This enzyme complex catalyzes the reversible oxidation of Carbon monoxide to Carbon dioxide. It also catalyzes the cleavage (or synthesis) of acetyl-CoA to (or from) methyltetrahydromethanopterin, carbon monoxide, and Coenzyme A.",
