    "comment": "Requires a divalent metal ion for activity, with Mg2+ being better than Mn2+ [1]. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate is a monoterpene with a non-head-to-tail linkage. It is unlike most monoterpenoids, which are derived from geranyl diphosphate and have isoprene units that are linked head-to-tail. The mechanism of its formation is similar to that of the early steps of {terp/squalphyto::squalene and phytoene biosynthesis}. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate is the precursor of chrysanthemic acid, the acid half of the pyrethroid insecticides found in chrysanthemums.",
