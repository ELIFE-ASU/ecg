    "comment": "Lavandulyl diphosphate is a monoterpene with a non-head-to-tail linkage. It is unlike most monoterpenoids, which are derived from geranyl diphosphate and have isoprene units that are linked head-to-tail. When this enzyme is incubated with dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate, it also forms the regular monoterpene geranyl diphosphate [2]. The enzyme from Artemisia tridentata (big sagebrush) forms both lavandulyl diphosphate and chrysanthemyl diphosphate (see EC 2.5.1.67, chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase) when dimethylally diphosphate is the sole substrate.",
