    "comment": "This enzyme, from the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. WH8102, differs from EC 2.1.1.157, sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase in that it cannot use sarcosine as an alternative substrate [1]. Betaine is a 'compatible solute' that enables cyanobacteria to cope with osmotic stress by maintaining a positive cellular turgor.",
