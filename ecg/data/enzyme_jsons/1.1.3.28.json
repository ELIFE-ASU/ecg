    "comment": "Other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (as well as 2'-deoxyribonucleosides) are substrates, but ribose and nucleotides are not substrates. The overall reaction takes place in two separate steps, with the 5'-dehydro nucleoside being released from the enzyme to serve as substrate for the second reaction. This enzyme differs from EC 1.1.3.39, nucleoside oxidase (H2O2-forming), as it produces water rather than hydrogen peroxide.",
