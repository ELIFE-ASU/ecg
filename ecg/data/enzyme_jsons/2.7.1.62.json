    "comment": "Activity is observed with several hexoses; of these glucose is the best substrate and the product from it is alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate. The phosphoramidate donor can be replaced by N-phosphoglycine and by an N-phosphohistidine. May be identical with EC 3.1.3.9 glucose-6-phosphatase.",
