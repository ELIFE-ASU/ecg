    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Streptomyces rimosus, participates in the biosynthesis of tetracycline antibiotics. That bacterium possesses two enzymes that can catalyse the reaction - OxyE is the main isozyme, while OxyL has a lower activity. OxyL is bifunctional, and its main function is EC 1.14.13.233, 4-hydroxy-6-methylpretetramide 12a-monooxygenase. Contains FAD.",
