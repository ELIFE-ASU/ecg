    "comment": "This enzyme, which has been characterized from the proteobacterium Marichromatium gracile, is a chimeric protein, containing a peroxiredoxin-like N-terminus and a glutaredoxin-like C terminus. The enzyme has peroxidase activity towards hydrogen peroxide and several small alkyl hydroperoxides, and is thought to represent an early adaptation for fighting oxidative stress [1]. The glutathione amide disulfide produced by this enzyme can be restored to glutathione amide by EC 1.8.1.16 (glutathione amide reductase).",
