    "comment": "This enzyme catalyses the first reaction in the pathway of carbazole degradation. The enzyme attacks at the 1 and 9a positions of carbazole, resulting in the formation of a highly unstable hemiaminal intermediate that undergoes a spontaneous cleavage and rearomatization, resulting in 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol. In most bacteria the enzyme is a complex composed of a terminal oxygenase, a ferredoxin, and a ferredoxin reductase. The terminal oxygenase component contains a nonheme iron centre and a Rieske [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster.",
