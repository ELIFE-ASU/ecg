    "comment": "The enzyme participates in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, whose main purpose is to produce reducing power and pentose for biosynthetic reactions. Unlike EC 1.1.1.44, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (NADP+-dependent, decarboxylating), it is not specific for NADP+ and can accept both cofactors with similar efficiency. cf. EC 1.1.1.343, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [NAD+-dependent, decarboxylating].",
