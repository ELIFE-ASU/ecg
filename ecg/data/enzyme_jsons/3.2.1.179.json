The enzyme can also hydrolyse unsaturated chondroitin and hyaluronate disaccharides (beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-D-GalNAc, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-D-GalNAc6S, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp2S-(1->3)-D-GalNAc, beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc), preferring the unsulfated disaccharides to the sulfated disaccharides.",
