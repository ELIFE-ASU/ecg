    "comment": "3-(5-Oxoisoxazolin-4-yl)-L-alanine is an antifungal antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces platensis. The enzymes from the plants Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea), L. sativus (grass pea) and Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) that catalyse EC 2.5.1.118 (beta-(isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl)-L-alanine synthase) also catalyse this reaction in vitro, but not in vivo. Closely related and possibly identical to EC 2.5.1.47, cysteine synthase, and EC 2.5.1.51, beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase.",
