    "comment": "The enzyme from the bacterium Colwellia psychrerythraea is involved in trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline metabolism. In contrast to EC 1.5.1.1, 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase [NAD(P)H], which shows similar activity with 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate and 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate, this enzyme is specific for the latter. While the enzyme is active with both NADH and NADPH, activity is higher with NADPH.",
