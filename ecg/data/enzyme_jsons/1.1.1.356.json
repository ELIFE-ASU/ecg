    "comment": "The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of L-colitose, a 3,6-dideoxyhexose found in the O-antigen of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides, where it catalyses the reaction in the reverse direction. The enzyme also performs the NAD(P)H-dependent epimerisation at C-5 of the sugar. The enzyme from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is Si-specific with respect to NAD(P)H [1].",
