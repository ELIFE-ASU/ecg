    "comment": "This is one of two simultaneous reactions catalysed by the enzyme, which is responsible for ethylene production in bacteria of the Pseudomonas syringae group. In the other reaction [EC 1.14.11.34, 2-oxoglutarate/L-arginine monooxygenase/decarboxylase (succinate-forming)] the enzyme catalyses the mono-oxygenation of both 2-oxoglutarate and L-arginine, forming succinate, carbon dioxide and L-hydroxyarginine, which is subsequently cleaved into guanidine and (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The enzymes catalyse two cycles of the ethylene-forming reaction for each cycle of the succinate-forming reaction, so that the stoichiometry of the products ethylene and succinate is 2:1.",
