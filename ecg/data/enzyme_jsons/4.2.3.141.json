    "comment": "Isolated from the plant Salvia sclarea (clary sage). Originally thought to be synthesized in one step from geranylgeranyl diphosphate it is now known to require two enzymes, EC 4.2.1.133, copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase and EC 4.2.3.141, sclareol synthase. Sclareol is used in perfumery.",
