    "comment": "A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). This enzyme catalyses a step in the pathway of abietic acid biosynthesis. The activity has been demonstrated in cell-free stem extracts of Abies grandis (grand fir) and Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine). The enzyme is localized in the microsomal fraction and requires both oxygen and NADPH. Inhibition by carbon monoxide and several substituted N-heterocyclic inhibitors suggests that the enzyme is a cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase [1]. Activity is induced by wounding of the plant tissue [2].",
