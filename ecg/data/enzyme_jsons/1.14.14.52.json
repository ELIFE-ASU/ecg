The enzyme, characterized from the plant Perilla frutescens, participates in the biosynthesis of perillyl aldehyde, the major constituent of the essential oil that accumulates in the glandular trichomes of this plant. Some forms of the enzyme also catalyse the oxidation of (-)-perillyl alcohol to (-)-perillyl aldehyde.",
