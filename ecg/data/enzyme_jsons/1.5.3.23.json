    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacterium Ochrobactrum sp. G-1, contains an FAD cofactor. The catalytic cycle starts with a reduction of the FAD cofactor by one molecule of glyphosate, yielding reduced FAD and a Schiff base of aminomethylphosphonate with glyoxylate that is hydrolysed to the single components. The reduced FAD is reoxidized by oxygen, generating water and an oxygenated flavin intermediate, which catalyses the oxygenation of a second molecule of glyphosate, forming the second pair of aminomethylphosphonate and glyoxylate.",
