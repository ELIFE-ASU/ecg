    "comment": "In the reverse reaction, the 2'-hydroxyisoflavone (2'-hydroxydaidzein) is reduced to an isoflavanone. Also acts on 2'-hydroxyformononetin and to a small extent on 2'-hydroxygenistein. Involved in the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin glyceollin. The isoflavones biochanin A, daidzein and genestein as well as the flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol and quercetin do not act as substrates.",
