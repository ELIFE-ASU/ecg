    "comment": "Requires Mn2+ for maximum activity. The reaction is suggested to take place in several steps. Schiff base formation, double bond migration and dephosphorylation followed by ring opening and closing to form a pyrrolidine ring, and finally dehydration to form the product 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoate. In the bacterium Streptomyces griseus the enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of grixazone, a yellow pigment that contains a phenoxazinone chromophore.",
