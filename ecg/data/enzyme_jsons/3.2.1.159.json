    "comment": "When neoagarohexaose is used as a substrate, the oligosaccharide is cleaved at the non-reducing end to produce 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and agaropentaose, which is further hydrolysed to agarobiose and agarotriose. With neoagarotetraose as substrate, the products are predominantly agarotriose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose. In Vibrio sp. the actions of EC 3.2.1.81, beta-agarase and EC 3.2.1.159 can be used to degrade agarose to 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose and D-galactose.",
