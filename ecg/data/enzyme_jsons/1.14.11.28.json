Unlike the proline hydroxylases involved in collagen biosynthesis [EC 1.14.11.2 (procollagen-proline dioxygenase) and EC 1.14.11.7 (procollagen-proline 3-dioxygenase)], this enzyme does not require ascorbate for activity although it does increase the activity of the enzyme [2]. The enzyme is specific for L-proline as D-proline, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline and 3,4-dehydro-DL-proline are not substrates [2].",
