Forms a two-component system with a flavoprotein reductase [1]. The enzymes from the bacteria Lysinibacillus sphaericus JS905 and Rhodococcus sp. strain PN1 were shown to also catalyse EC 1.14.13.29, 4-nitrophenol 2-monooxygenase [1,2] while the enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. WBC-3 was shown to also catalyse EC 1.14.13.167, 4-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase [3].",
