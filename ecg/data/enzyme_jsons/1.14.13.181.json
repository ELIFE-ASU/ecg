C5 and Streptomyces peucetius show broad substrate specificity for structures based on an anthracycline aglycone, but have a strong preference for 4-methoxy anthracycline intermediates (13-deoxydaunorubicin and 13-dihydrodaunorubicin) over their 4-hydroxy analogues (13-deoxycarminomycin and 13-dihydrocarminomycin), as well as a preference for substrates hydroxylated at the C-13 rather than the C-14 position.",
