    "comment": "A polyketide synthase characterized from the plant Oryza sativa (rice) that catalyses the formation of the C6-C7-C6 diarylheptanoid scaffold of bisdemethoxycurcumin. Unlike the process in the plant Curcuma longa (turmeric), where the conversion is carried out via a diketide intermediate by two different enzymes (EC 2.3.1.218, phenylpropanoylacetyl-CoA synthase and EC 2.3.1.217, curcumin synthase), the diketide intermediate formed by this enzyme remains within the enzyme's cavity and is not released to the environment.",
