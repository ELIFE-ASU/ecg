    "comment": "Best known from foot-and-mouth disease virus, but occurs in other aphthoviruses and cardioviruses. Destruction of initiation factor eIF-4G has the effect of shutting off host-cell protein synthesis while allowing synthesis of viral proteins to continue. The tertiary structure reveals a distant relationship to papain and, consistent with this, compound E-64 is inhibitory. Type example of peptidase family C28.",
