    "comment": "Catalyses the transfer of arachidonate and other polyenoic fatty acids from intact choline or ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids to the sn-2 position of a lyso-glycerophospholipid. The organyl group on sn-1 of the donor or acceptor molecule can be alkyl, acyl or alk-1-enyl. The term 'radyl' has sometimes been used to refer to such substituting groups. Differs from EC 2.3.1.148 glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent) in not requiring CoA and in its specificity for poly-unsaturated acyl groups.",
