    "comment": "The enzyme from the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii catalyses the reversible oxidation of (2R)-3-sulfolactate and (S)-malate to 3-sulfopyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively (note that (2R)-3-sulfolactate has the same stereochemical configuration as (2S)-2-hydroxycarboxylates) [1]. The enzyme can use both NADH and NADPH, although activity is higher with NADPH [1-3]. The oxidation of (2R)-3-sulfolactate was observed only in the presence of NADP+ [1]. The same organism also possesses an NAD+-specific enzyme with similar activity, cf. EC 1.1.1.337, L-2-hydroxycarboxylate dehydrogenase (NAD+).",
