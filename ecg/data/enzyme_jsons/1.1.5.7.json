    "comment": "This enzyme oxidizes a wide variety of cyclic alcohols. Some minor enzyme activity is found with aliphatic secondary alcohols and sugar alcohols, but not primary alcohols. The enzyme is unable to catalyse the reverse reaction of cyclic ketones or aldehydes to cyclic alcohols. This enzyme differs from EC 1.1.5.5, alcohol dehydrogenase (quinone), which shows activity with ethanol [1].",
