    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the the plant Sorghum bicolor, is involved in the biosynthesis of sorgoleone, an allelopathic compound produced in root hair cells. The enzyme inserts a cis double bond at carbon 15. When acting on its natural substrate, (9Z,12Z)-hexadeca-9,12-dienoyl-CoA, it produces a product with a terminal double bond.",
