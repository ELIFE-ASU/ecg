    "comment": "The enzyme from the bacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca catalyses the final step in the conversion of aurachin C to aurachin B. In vivo the enzyme catalyses the reduction of 4-[(2E,6E)-farnesyl]-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinoline-1-oxide to form 4-[(2E,6E)-farnesyl]-2-methyl-1-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinoline-3,4-diol (note that the reactions written above proceed from right to left), which then undergoes a spontaneous dehydration to form aurachin B.",
