    "comment": "A cytochrome P-450 (heme-thiolate) protein. The enzyme catalyses an oxidative C-C bond cleavage of long-chain acyl-[acyl-carrier protein]s of various lengths to generate pimeloyl-[acyl-carrier protein], an intermediate in the biosynthesis of biotin. The preferred substrate of the enzyme from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is palmitoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] which then gives heptanal as the alkanal. The mechanism is similar to EC 1.14.15.6, cholesterol monooxygenase (side-chain-cleaving), followed by a hydroxylation step, which may occur spontaneously [2].",
