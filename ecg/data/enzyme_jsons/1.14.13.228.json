    "comment": "Although believed to occur in plants, the enzyme has so far been characterized only from the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. The fungus strategically deploys the enzyme to hydroxylate and inactivate endogenous jasmonate to evade the jasmonate-based innate immunity in rice plants.",
