    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the silk moth Bombyx mori, catalyses a step in the pathway for the biosynthesis of bombykol, a sex pheromone produced by the moth. The enzyme converts a single cis double bond at position 11 of (11Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-CoA into conjugated 10 trans and 12 cis double bonds. Prior to catalysing this reaction, the enzyme catalyses the introduction of the cis bond in position 11 (cf. EC 1.14.19.5, acyl-CoA 11-desaturase).",
