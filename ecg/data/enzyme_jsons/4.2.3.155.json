    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the bacteria Actinosynnema mirum and Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, produces 2-epi-valiolone, which is believed to function as a precursor in aminocyclitol biosynthesis. It requires a divalent metal ion (Zn2+ or Co2+) and an NAD+ cofactor, which is transiently reduced during the reaction. cf. EC 4.2.3.152, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase and EC 4.2.3.154, demethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase.",
