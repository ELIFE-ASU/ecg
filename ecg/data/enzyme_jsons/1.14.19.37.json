    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the plant Anemone leveillei, introduces a cis double bond at carbon 5 of acyl-CoAs that do not contain a double bond at position 8. In vivo it forms non-methylene-interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids such as sciadonate and juniperonate. When expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana the enzyme could also act on unsaturated substrates such as palmitoyl-CoA. cf. EC 1.14.19.44, acyl-CoA (8-3)-desaturase.",
