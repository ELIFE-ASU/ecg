    "comment": "This enzyme, isolated from the bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans, participates in the pathway of tryptophan degradation. The enzyme is part of a system that also includes a bifunctional riboflavin kinase/FMN adenylyltransferase and an FAD reductase, which ensures ample supply of FAD to the monooxygenase.",
