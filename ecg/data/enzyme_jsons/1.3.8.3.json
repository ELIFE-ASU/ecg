    "comment": "Requires FAD as prosthetic group. Unlike other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, this enzyme exhibits high substrate- and enantiomer specificity; it is highly specific for (R)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA and is inhibited by (S)-benzylsuccinyl-CoA. Forms the third step in the anaerobic toluene metabolic pathway in Thauera aromatica. Ferricenium ion is an effective artificial electron acceptor.",
