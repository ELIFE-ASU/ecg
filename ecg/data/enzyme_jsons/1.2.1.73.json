    "comment": "This reaction is part of a bacterial pathway that can utilize the amino group of taurine as a sole source of nitrogen for growth. At physiological concentrations, NAD+ cannot be replaced by NADP+. The enzyme is specific for sulfoacetaldehyde, as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, betaine aldehyde, propanal, glyceraldehyde, phosphonoacetaldehyde, glyoxylate, glycolaldehyde and 2-oxobutyrate are not substrates.",
