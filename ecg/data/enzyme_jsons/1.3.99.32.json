    "comment": "The enzyme contains FAD. The anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfococcus multivorans contains two glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenases: a decarboxylating enzyme (EC 1.3.8.6), and a nondecarboxylating enzyme (this entry). The two enzymes cause different structural changes around the glutaconyl carboxylate group, primarily due to the presence of either a tyrosine or a valine residue, respectively, at the active site.",
