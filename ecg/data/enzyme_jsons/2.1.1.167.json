    "comment": "Spb1p is a site-specific 2'-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase that catalyses the formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine2922, a universally conserved position of the catalytic center of the ribosome that is essential for translation. 2'-O-Methylguanosine2922 is formed at a later stage of the processing, during the maturation of of the 27S pre-rRNA. In absence of snR52, Spb1p can also catalyse the formation of uridine2921 [1].",
