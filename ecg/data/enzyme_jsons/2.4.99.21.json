    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the archaea Methanococcus voltae and Haloferax volcanii, transfers a glycan component from dolichyl phosphooligosaccharide to external proteins. It is different from EC 2.4.99.18, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycotransferase, which uses dolichyl diphosphate as carrier compound in bacteria and eukaryotes. The enzyme participates in the N-glycosylation of proteins in some archaea. It requires Mn2+. Dolichol used by archaea is different from that used by eukaryotes. It is much shorter (C55-C60), it is alpha,omega-saturated and it may have additional unsaturated positions in the chain.",
