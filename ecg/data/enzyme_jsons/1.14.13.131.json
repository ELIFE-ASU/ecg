    "comment": "The enzyme has lower activity with diethyl sulfide and other short-chain alkyl methyl sulfides. Its activity is stimulated by combined addition of FMN, and, after depletion of cations, of Mg2+ and Fe2+. The enzyme from Hyphomicrobium is a two component system that includes an FMN-dependent reductase subunit and a monooxygenase subunit.",
