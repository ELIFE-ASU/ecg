    "comment": "The enzyme, characterized from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, is involved in the biosynthesis of the sunscreen compound shinorine. It requires a divalent metal ion (Zn2+ or Co2+) and an NAD+ cofactor, which is transiently reduced during the reaction. cf. EC 4.2.3.152, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase and EC 4.2.3.155, 2-epi-valiolone synthase.",
