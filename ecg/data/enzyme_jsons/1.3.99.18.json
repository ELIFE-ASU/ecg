    "comment": "The enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. AK2 also acts on quinoline-8-carboxylate, whereas that from Serratia marcescens 2CC-1 will oxidize nicotinate; quinaldate is a substrate for both of these enzymes. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonate, 1,4-benzoquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, nitroblue tetrazolium, thionine and menadione will serve as an electron acceptor for the former enzyme and ferricyanide for the latter; Meldola blue, iodonitrotetrazolium chloride, phenazine methosulfate, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and cytochrome c will act as electron acceptors for both.",
