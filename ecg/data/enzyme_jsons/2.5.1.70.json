    "comment": "Requires Mg2+. This membrane-bound protein is located in the plastids [2]. In addition to naringenin, the enzyme can prenylate several other flavanones at the C-8 position, but more slowly. Along with EC 1.14.13.103 (8-dimethylallylnaringenin 2'-hydroxylase) and EC 2.5.1.71 (leachianone G 2''-dimethylallyltransferase), this enzyme forms part of the sophoraflavanone-G-biosynthesis pathway.",
