    "comment": "In the proteobacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus, this enzyme modulates the activity of EC 4.1.3.6, citrate (pro-3S)-lyase, by converting it from its active acetyl form into its inactive thiol form by removal of its acetyl groups [2]. The activity of citrate-lyase deacetylase is itself inhibited by L-glutamate [2].",
