    "comment": "This cytochrome P-450 (heme thiolate) enzyme, which has been characterized from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, catalyses the last two steps in the biosynthesis of camalexin, the main phytoalexin in that plant. The enzyme catalyses two successive oxidation events. During the first oxidation the enzyme introduces a C-N double bond, liberating hydrogen cyanide, and during the second oxidation it catalyses a decarboxylation.",
