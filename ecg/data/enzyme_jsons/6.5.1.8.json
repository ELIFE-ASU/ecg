    "comment": "The enzyme is a GTP- and Mn2+-dependent 3'-5' nucleic acid ligase with the ability to join RNA with 3'-phosphate or 2',3'-cyclic-phosphate ends to RNA with 5'-hydroxy ends. It can also join DNA with 3'-phosphate ends to DNA with 5'-hydroxy ends, provided the DNA termini are unpaired [6]. The enzyme is found in members of all three kingdoms of life, and is essential in metazoa for the splicing of intron-containing tRNAs. The reaction follows a three-step mechanism with initial activation of the enzyme by GTP hydrolysis, forming a phosphoramide bond between the guanylate and a histidine residue. The guanylate group is transferred to the 3'-phosphate terminus of the substrate, forming the capped structure [DNA/RNA]-3'-(5'-diphosphoguanosine). When a suitable 5'-OH end is available, the enzyme catalyses an attack of the 5'-OH on the capped end to form a 3'-5' phosphodiester splice junction, releasing the guanylate. When acting on an RNA 2',3'-cyclic-phosphate, the enzyme catalyses an additional reaction, hydrolysing the cyclic phosphate to a 3'-phosphate [9]. The metazoan enzyme requires activating cofactors in order to achieve multiple turnover catalysis [8].",
