    "comment": "The enzyme from the heterotrophic nitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans contains three to five non-heme, non-iron-sulfur iron atoms and interacts with cytochrome c556 and pseudoazurin [2,3]. Under anaerobic conditions in vitro only nitrous oxide is formed [3]. Presumably nitroxyl is released and combines with a second nitroxyl to give nitrous oxide and water. When oxygen is present, nitrite is formed.",
